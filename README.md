# Brooklyn Tivix Bot

This is a nodejs practice project.
Like all projects it has goals.
Granted.. at this time I'm not certain what the goals are here.

#### Goals
* Learn to write cleaner nodejs
* ~Make a slack bot~
* Help with Tivix lunch protocols for NYC office
* ~Use Circle 2.0~ (Decided to go with circle 2.0 to test new beta version)
* Learn about real language parsers in nodejs (as opposed to rgexp
* Use MQTT and mosca for simple IOT actions
* Have a raspberry pi setup with audio to speak commands from slack
